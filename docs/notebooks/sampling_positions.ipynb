    "LightCurveLynx provides multiple mechanisms for sampling (RA, dec) from choosing points uniformly on a sphere to using the footprint of a given survey. In this notebook we discuss several of the approaches and their relative tradeoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx matches the sampled positions (RA, dec) with the survey information (`ObsTable`) to determine when each object is observed. Points from the object's light curve are *only* generated at those times where the object is observed. For example if an object is at (45.0, -10.0) and the survey includes this points at MJDs 60676.0 and 60678.0, the generated light curve will only have two fluxes. More importantly, if the sampled position falls outside the survey's footprint the returned light curve will be empty (the object is never observed). Therefor it is critical to choose a reasonable sampling scheme.\n",
